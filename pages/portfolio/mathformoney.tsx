                    MathforMoney is a math app that lets children solve math
                    problems to earn their pocket money. The aim was to provide
                    strong incentives for children to improve their financial
                    literacy skills and implement gamification techniques to
                    make the learning fun and engaging.

                    Because the app is designed for children, we wanted to keep
                    it as simple as possible, allowing children to reach their
                    desired outcome with ease and haste. After sketching out a
                    few low fidelity prototypes, we mocked it up to create a
                    quick click-through prototype which could be used to test
                    with early customers.

                  We conducted a series of interviews and workshops with
                  families and schools to create a product that supports parents
                  with the difficult task of teaching children about the value
                  of money.

                  Together, we discovered that children could quickly understand
                  the impact of compound interest through simple goals and
                  savings rewards. Small motivational techniques encouraged
                  children to overcome their math anxiety to unlock badges and
                  feel celebrated for solving complex word problems.

                  Another solution to help children grow their math confidence
                  was to adjust the difficulty to the childâ€™s ability and allow
                  them to build up slowly instead of forcing them into the level
                  of their school syllabus.

                  Using a clean UI and playful colours we created an app that
                  can be enjoyed by both children and parents alike. Little math
                  monsters help children to stay on track and build the
                  confidence to tackle challenging problems.
